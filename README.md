# Motor-ESP-simulation-on-Arduino

The primary objective of this project was to develop a system entirely based on the object-oriented paradigm. The system, known as the Electronic Stability Program (ESP), aims to enhance the stability of vehicles by effectively identifying and mitigating instances of traction loss. To achieve this, the ESP system utilizes a sensor to detect such occurrences, and when triggered, it employs a DC motor that gradually decelerates to a specific value, effectively simulating the functionality of ESP. By implementing the project in an object-oriented manner, we ensure a more seamless and cohesive design, facilitating easier maintenance and extensibility.
