# Motor-ESP-simulation-on-Arduino
The main goal of this project was to write it completely in object oriented paradigm.
EPS ( Electronic Stability Program ) improves vechile's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction.
In this case the DC motor slows down to the certian value when the sensor is active which simulates ESP.


## Project contains:
1. Aduino files in "project" directory.
2. Console app in "data" directory.
